# Feedback on Final

Overall, I think you did a good job demonstrating most of the skills we learned this semester.
1. One of the requirements was to use function to abstract or encapsulate logic. I didn't see that except in your `get_files()` function.
2. Your project could have use a bit more documentation / explanation in the middle. Just a bit more detail about what you were doing and why.
